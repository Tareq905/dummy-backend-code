Dear All,

As development continues, there is increasing ambiguity around the intended implementation direction. Continuing without clarity may result in rework later in the cycle.

Several components are currently blocked, as they depend on a clear confirmation of the preferred approach from stakeholders.

At this point, a decision is needed on which option we will commit to so the team can align their efforts. Once confirmed, implementation will resume immediately based on the agreed direction.

Your timely input will help us avoid unnecessary delays.

Sincerely,
Md Tareq Shah Alam
