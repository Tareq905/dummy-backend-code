Hello Team,

While most of the deliverables are nearing completion, one outstanding approval remains unresolved. If this continues, it could affect our ability to finalise the release as planned.

Completion of the remaining work is directly linked to confirmation from the compliance review, without which we cannot proceed to sign-off.

We need to determine whether to wait for formal approval or proceed with a conditional release approach. Following confirmation, the team will either pause or complete the final steps accordingly.

Please advise on how you would like to proceed.

Best,
Md Tareq Shah Alam
