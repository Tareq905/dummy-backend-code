Dear Team,

I want to bring attention to the current workload distribution, which is starting to stretch available capacity. If this continues, there is a possibility that quality or timelines could be impacted.

Several deliverables are currently dependent on the same small group of resources, creating a bottleneck that limits parallel progress.

At this stage, we should decide whether to reprioritise existing tasks or temporarily assign additional support to balance the load. Once agreed, I will coordinate the necessary adjustments and communicate the updated plan.

Please share your thoughts at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
Md Tareq Shah Alam
