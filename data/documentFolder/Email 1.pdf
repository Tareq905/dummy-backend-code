Hello Team,

As we move closer to the next delivery window, I want to flag a concern around the current pace of execution. Some activities have taken longer than initially anticipated, which may start to compress our remaining buffer.

At the moment, further progress is tied closely to the final inputs expected from the backend team. Without those, downstream tasks will remain blocked.

Given this, we should align on whether we proceed with the existing schedule by reallocating effort, or formally adjust the delivery date to reflect current realities. Once aligned, we can immediately implement the agreed approach and update the plan accordingly.

Please share your view so we can move forward without ambiguity.

Best regards,
Md Tareq Shah Alam
