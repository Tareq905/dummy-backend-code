Hello Everyone,

During the latest review, it became clear that the integration work is progressing unevenly across environments. This increases the chance of unexpected behaviour closer to release.

Most of the outstanding items rely on updates that are still pending from our external vendor. Until those are received, our testing coverage will remain partial.

We need to agree on whether to wait for the vendor’s confirmed timeline or move ahead with an internal workaround to protect the release window. Once a direction is confirmed, the team can immediately execute and adjust testing plans.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Regards,
Md Tareq Shah Alam
